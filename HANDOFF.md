# JakeCrate — Development Handoff

**Last updated:** 2026-07-01  
**Live URL:** https://jakecrate.onrender.com  
**Repo:** GitHub `Endro11/JakeCrate`, branch `master`  
**Deploy:** Push to `master` → Render auto-deploys (free tier, may spin down ~30s first load)

---

## What This Is

A browser-based party game hub for 2–12 players on voice/video call. Players open the URL, one person creates a room and shares the 4-letter code, everyone joins with their name. Host picks a game and starts it.

**Stack:** Node.js + Express + Socket.io (server). Single-file vanilla HTML/CSS/JS client (`public/index.html`, ~5800 lines). No framework, no build step.

**DO NOT run locally on Windows.** npm throws "Exit handler never called" and hangs. Always verify on the Render deployment. Syntax-check server with: `node -e "require('./index.js')"` — a clean run shows `Cannot find module 'express'` (no local deps), not a syntax error.

## Architecture

### Server (`index.js`)

All state lives in `rooms[code]` — one object per active room. `makeRoom(code)` initializes it. Key shared fields:

```js
{
  code, players, scores, avatars, feedMaps, feedNames, playerState,
  lastReactionTimes, hostSocketId, hostToken, seekerSocketId, seekerToken,
  seekerPokesLeft, gamePhase, selectedGame, strokePainting, timeLeft,
  lastHideTime, lastSeekTime, gameTimer, gameVotes,
  // MasterPieced (strokeoff):
  strokePrompt, strokeTheme, strokeFakeId, strokeHistory, strokeVotes,
  strokePlayerParts, strokePhase, soScores, revealTimer,
  // PikPic:
  ppPhase, ppRound, ppTotalRounds, ppStorytellerId, ppDeck, ppHands,
  ppClue, ppSubmissions, ppSubUsed, ppScores,
  // Rizz or Roast:
  rrPhase, rrPrompts, rrSubmissions, rrRecordings, rrVotes, rrScores,
  // Split Crew: (canvas-rendered, team state tracked per team)
  scPhase, scTeams, scLap, scScores,
  // Squiggle (Stroke Off):
  sqPhase, sqPrompts, sqPairs, sqVotes, sqScores,
}
```

**Helper functions:**
- `socketRoom(socket)` — finds the room a socket is in
- `broadcastRoom(room, event, data)` — emits to all sockets in the room
- `broadcastGameState(room)` — broadcasts `gameState` (phase, timer, seekerSocketId, hostSocketId)
- `isHost(room, socket)` — checks/assigns host
- `transferHostIfNeeded(room)` — promotes next player if host slot is empty

**Token-based dedup:** Each player has a `token` (UUID stored in `localStorage`). On `joinRoom`, if a stale socket with the same token exists, it's evicted. Handles page refreshes and duplicate tabs.

**Player cap:** 12 players per room, max 300 concurrent rooms, rate-limited room creation.

### Client (`public/index.html`)

Screens are absolutely-positioned `<div>` elements layered by z-index, shown/hidden via `display`. Key z-indexes:

| Screen | ID | z-index |
|--------|-----|---------|
| Hub (home) | `#hub-screen` | 50 |
| Room lobby | `#room-lobby` | 48 |
| TS game canvas | `<canvas>` | (base) |
| SO/MP draw screen | `#so-screen` | 45 |
| SO/MP memorize | `#so-memorize-screen` | 46 |
| PikPic screens | `#pp-*-screen` | 55 |
| Rules overlays | `.game-rules-overlay` | 70 |
| TS rules overlay | `#ts-rules-overlay` | 90 (fixed) |

**Key global client variables:**
```js
let socket, inRoom, isRoomHost, isJoined, selectedGame, hostId;
let playerName, myToken, otherPlayers, seekerSocketId;
let gamePhase, isDead, deadAt;
let cHue, cSat, cLight;  // active brush color (HSL)
let activeColor;          // computed CSS color string
let camera = { x, y, scale };
let SPACE_W = 1600, SPACE_H = 900;  // world dimensions
const playerSize = 75;
```

## Game 1: Sleight of Hands (`tacostealth`)

**Display name:** Sleight of Hands · Tagline: "Paint your hand to blend in — the seeker pokes to find you"  
**Minimum players:** 2

**How it works:**
1. All hiders place their hand blob on the room photo background (kitchen/dining/drive-thru scenes) and paint it to blend in
2. When seeking starts, the seeker pans/zooms and pokes blobs to identify players
3. Caught players fall off screen. Survivors win.
4. Infection mode: caught hiders become seekers

**Phase flow:** `LOBBY → HIDING → SEEKING → REVEAL → LOBBY`

**Server events → client:**
- `gameState` — phase, timeLeft, seekerSocketId, hostSocketId, pokesLeft
- `updatePlayers` — full player map (positions, colors, isDead, etc.)
- `triggerPickleSlide` — you got poked, you're dead (fall animation)
- `revealResult` — reveal screen with who survived

**Client events → server:**
- `playerMove`, `paintStroke`, `pokeTrigger`, `volunteer`, `startGame`

**UI notes:**
- Floating mode toggle (green=paint / blue=move)
- Right-side tool rail: eyedropper MATCH, color swatch, brush ±, undo, flip, hand menu, whistle, reactions, lock-in
- Lock-in: hider taps lock when satisfied → editing disabled; if all lock in early, seek begins
- Seeker crosshair reticle; poke has 700ms cooldown; poke count = number of players
- `hideSelf = meSeeker() && phase === 'HIDING' || 'SEEKING'` — seeker never sees their own avatar
- Dead animation: `deadSlide(elapsed)` falls 1500px out of world space over 1.2 seconds

**Canvas:** Main `<canvas>` fills viewport. Camera has pan/zoom (pinch mobile, wheel desktop, right-drag desktop). World = 1600×900. Player blobs = 75×75px world space.

**Score tracking (`room.scores[playerName]`):**
- `survivals` — rounds survived
- `catches` — players caught as seeker

---

## Game 2: MasterPieced (`strokeoff`)

**Display name:** MasterPieced · Tagline: "Draw a famous painting from memory — one player is the fake"  
**Minimum players:** 3

**How it works:**
1. A meme image shown to all players for 20 seconds (memorize)
2. Each player gets a different named part of the image to draw from memory (75 seconds)
3. One player is THE FAKE — they get `???` and must bluff
4. After drawing, players vote on who the fake is
5. Fake escapes = fake wins; fake caught = real players win

**Phase flow:** `LOBBY → MEMORIZE → DRAWING → REVEAL → VOTE → RESULT → LOBBY`

**Constants:** `MEMORIZE_SECONDS = 20`, `DRAW_SECONDS = 75`, `SO_REVEAL_MS = 4500`, `SO_VOTE_DURATION = 20`

**Images:** Meme images (replaced original Wikimedia paintings June 2026 — fixed broken URL issue). Each has 8 named `parts`. Parts assigned round-robin; fake gets `???`.

**Server events → client:**
- `soShowPainting` — `{imageUrl, title, artist, yourPart, memorizeSeconds}`
- `soBeginDrawing` — `{prompt, part}`
- `soStroke` — rebroadcasted stroke (real-time sync)
- `soRedraw` — full history redraw after undo
- `soRevealBegin` — `{history, players, prompt}`
- `soRevealNext` — `{player, idx, total}`
- `soVoteOpen` — `{players, prompt, emoji, timeLeft}`
- `soVoteResult` — `{fakeId, fakeName, fakeCaught, tallies, players, soScores}`
- `strokePhaseChange` — `{phase, timeLeft}`

**Client events → server:** `soStroke`, `soUndo`, `soVote`, `soReturnToLobby`

**Canvas:** `<canvas id="so-canvas" width="450" height="800">` (portrait). CSS-scaled to fit. No camera transform — all coordinates are canvas-local.

**Stroke storage:** `room.strokeHistory` = array of `{socketId, x1, y1, x2, y2, color, size, t, gid}`. `gid` (gesture ID) increments per mousedown/touchstart. `soUndo` removes all strokes with matching socketId+gid.

**Thumbnail:** `#so-draw-thumb` shows small version of image during drawing. Tap to eyedrop color. Uses `crossOrigin="anonymous"`.

**Score tracking (`room.soScores[playerName]`):**
- `correct` — correctly voted for the fake
- `fakeWins` — successfully bluffed as the fake

---

## Game 3: Stroke Off (`squiggle`)

**Display name:** Stroke Off · Tagline: "Turn a squiggle into art — 3 rounds, 1v1 battles, crowd votes"  
**Minimum players:** 2 (works best with 4+)

**How it works:**
1. Players receive a random prompt and a pre-drawn squiggle
2. They have drawing time to incorporate the squiggle into their art matching the prompt
3. Pairs of drawings are revealed 1v1; audience votes for their favorite
4. Bracket format: 3 rounds, points scale by round

**Phase flow:** `LOBBY → DRAWING → REVEAL → VOTE → RESULT → LOBBY`

**Socket events:**
- Server → client: `sqRoundStart`, `sqRevealPair`, `sqVoteResult`, `sqFinalResult`
- Client → server: `sqStartGame`, `sqStroke`, `sqVote`

**Canvas:** Same portrait canvas approach as MasterPieced, canvas-local coordinates.

**Score tracking:** Round wins (points scale with round number).

---

## Game 4: PikPic (`pikpic`)

**Display name:** PikPic · Tagline: "Upload your photos, deal a deck, give clues — Dixit with your camera roll"  
**Minimum players:** 3 (works best with 4+)

**How it works:**
1. Each player uploads 7 personal photos (or fills from curated stockpile)
2. Cards dealt from the uploaded pool to each player
3. The Curator (storyteller) picks a card and writes a clue
4. All other players pick a card from their hand that matches the clue
5. Cards shuffled and displayed; players vote for which is the Curator's real card
6. Scoring rewards difficulty balance (everyone guessing = Curator loses points; nobody guessing = also bad)
7. 3 rounds, rotating Curator

**Phase flow:** `LOBBY → UPLOAD → CLUE (Curator) / WAIT (others) → SUBMIT (others) / WAIT (Curator) → VOTE → RESULT → LOBBY`

**Key UI elements (rewritten 2026-07-01 — the drag-and-drop/hold-to-preview description below is stale, replaced twice this session):**
- Every photo everywhere (upload thumbnails, fan cards, result grid, vote carousel, full-screen preview) shares one `.pp-polaroid` CSS frame (white border, thick bottom margin, drop shadow) — previously only the fan had it.
- Upload grid: 4-column grid of polaroid-framed thumbnails, up to 7 photos; file input or selfie camera. `ppResizeToDataUrl`/`ppHandleFiles` (client-side resize to a 600px JPEG) now has a try/catch around the canvas draw/export step — a bug there let odd/old photos throw inside `img.onload` with nothing to catch it, silently hanging the promise forever and killing the rest of that upload batch. Also has a concurrency guard (re-opening the file picker mid-batch no longer interleaves) and a single summary toast instead of one per failure.
- Curated stockpile fill: `ppFillFromCurated()` fills remaining slots with server-side images
- Fan hand: `ppRenderFan(containerId, cards, mode)` — `mode='select'` (Curator choosing a clue card), `'drag'` (others submitting a matching pic), `'browse'` (view-only — used on the idle wait screen so players have their own hand to look at instead of a blank screen while waiting on someone else). Positions are a deterministic per-photo scattered "tossed on a table" jitter (`ppSeedRand`, seeded by cardId, not `Math.random()`) rather than a neat symmetric arc — re-rendering after a swap only moves the swapped photo.
- Tap to enlarge, unified everywhere via `#pp-lightbox`: single tap opens a large polaroid-framed preview with a context-appropriate action button ("Pick this pic" / "Vote this pic") when applicable, or just a close button for pure viewing (upload thumbnails, result grid, idle-wait browsing). There is no hold-gesture and no drag-and-drop — both were removed and replaced by this single system.
- Submit flow: tap a pic (via the lightbox's "Pick this pic" button, or double-tap to skip straight to it) to stage it into the small preview strip, then explicit SUBMIT / SWAP (once) buttons finalize it — not drag-and-drop.
- Vote carousel: swipe/prev-next nav with dots; tap a pic to preview large with a "Vote this pic" button that casts the vote directly (kept at 2 taps total to match the old flow).
- `ppSubUsed` flag: swap zone disabled after one use per round
- User-facing copy says "pic(s)" throughout, not "card(s)" (renamed 2026-07-01) — internal identifiers (`cardId`, `ppSelectCard`, etc.) still say "card" and are unaffected.

**Server events → client:**
- `ppRoundStart` — `{round, totalRounds, storytellerId, storytellerName, hand, ppScores, players, subUsed, timeLeft}`
- `ppClueSet` — `{clue, storytellerId, storytellerName}` — shows submit screen to others
- `ppSubmissionCount` — `{submitted, total}` — progress update
- `ppHandUpdate` — `{hand, subUsed}` — after swap
- `ppVoteOpen` — `{cards, clue, timeLeft}` — shuffled cards for voting
- `ppVoteResult` — `{storytellerId, correctCardId, votes, scores, players}`
- `ppRoundEnd` / `ppGameEnd`

**Client events → server:** `ppStartGame`, `ppUploadPhotos`, `ppSetClue`, `ppSubmitCard`, `ppSwapCard`, `ppVote`, `ppReturnToLobby`

**Score tracking (`room.ppScores[playerName]`):**
- Points per round based on vote distribution (Dixit-style)

**Known Android issues (fixed 2026-06-29):**
- ~~Touch drag-to-submit didn't work~~ — fixed via pointer-event drag + `setPointerCapture`
- ~~Hold-to-preview triggered browser context menu~~ — fixed with `oncontextmenu="return false"` + `-webkit-touch-callout:none`

## Game 5: Rizz or Roast (`rizzorroast`)

**Display name:** Rizz or Roast · Tagline: "Same madlib, different energy — fill it in, record yourself, go 1v1"  
**Minimum players:** 2

**How it works:**
1. Players receive a madlib template with blanks to fill
2. Each player fills in their version
3. Players record audio delivering their madlib response
4. Audience votes: RIZZ (charming) vs ROAST (savage) for each 1v1 matchup
5. Scoring: 3pts winner, 1pt loser, 2pts each on a tie

**Phase flow:** `LOBBY → FILL → RECORD → PLAYBACK/VOTE → RESULT → LOBBY`

**Socket events:**
- Server → client: `rrRoundStart`, `rrPlayback`, `rrVoteResult`, `rrGameEnd`
- Client → server: `rrStartGame`, `rrSubmitFills`, `rrSubmitRecording`, `rrVote`

**Audio:** Uses `MediaRecorder` API for in-browser audio capture. Recordings sent as blob → server stores and rebroadcasts for playback.

---

## Game 6: Split Crew (`splitcrew`)

**Display name:** Split Crew · Tagline: "One phone reads tasks, one does them — keep your diva driver happy"  
**Minimum players:** 2 (one instructor + one executor per team; scales to multiple teams)

**How it works:**
1. Teams split: one player is the Instructor (reads tasks from their screen), one is the Executor (performs them)
2. Tasks involve gauges, angles, sequences, timing
3. 3 laps; crashes eliminate a team
4. Quality scoring; highest score wins

**Drivers:** Chad, Brittney, Rico, Dale, Yuki, Fabrice — each has a character portrait sprite rendered on a canvas.

**Phase flow:** `LOBBY → RACING (3 laps) → RESULT`

**Socket events:**
- Server → client: `scGameStart`, `scTaskUpdate`, `scCrash`, `scLapComplete`, `scGameEnd`
- Client → server: `scStartGame`, `scCompleteTask`

**Canvas:** Character sprites and racing UI rendered on `<canvas>`. Cranks, dials, and gauges are canvas-drawn interactive elements with `touchstart`/`touchmove` handlers.

**Score tracking:** Tasks completed, quality points, lap times.

## Game 7: Bad Pitches (`beatbattle`) — ✅ v4 BREAKBEAT CRATE (2026-07-01, post-playtest iteration on top of the v3 rework)

**v4 changes (supersede parts of the v3 write-up below — driven by a real phone playtest):**
- **Source is now a fixed catalog of 36 legendary UBB drum breaks** (`BB_BREAK_CATALOG` in `index.js`; Archive.org item `ultimate-break-beats-complete` — Amen Brother, Apache, Funky Drummer, Impeach The President, Think (About It), The Payback…). The georgeblood jazz-78 search/pool (`bb_fetchBatch`/`bbSamplePool`/`bb_pickSample`) is **deleted**; boot no longer touches Archive.org at all. Rationale: playtest said the old jazz "didn't resonate", and breaks have far stronger transients for the snap-to-onset Chop.
- **DIG is interactive now**: each player is dealt a crate of 4 breaks (`bbDigPhase {options, timeLeft}`, 30s `BB_DIG_SECS`), taps a card to preview (`bbStreamPreview`), picks one (`bbPickBreak {idx}` → `bbBreakPicked {idx}` ack, validated against the dealt crate). Timer expiry auto-picks each non-picker's first option (`bb_endDig`). Replaces the old auto-assigned vinyl reveal — the `bbDigReady` event is gone.
- **The chopped beat finally PLAYS in Battle** — `bbBattleBegin`'s p1/p2 now carry `beat: {audioProxyUrl, start, end, rate}`; the client prefetch-decodes both on matchup start (`bbPrefetchBattleBeats`) and `bbHearVerse` loops the spitter's chop UNDER their TTS verse. This was the big v3 design hole: players made beats nobody ever heard, which made the game feel like Rizz or Roast with homework.
- Audio route: `/api/bb-break/:idx` (catalog-indexed, global byte cache) replaces `/api/bb-audio/:code/:playerId` and `/api/bb-thumb/:id`. Offline: dealable = catalog entries whose audio exists in `public/bb-cache/`; a stale jazz-era cache (manifest but no break files) falls back to the full catalog with a boot warning — re-run `bb-cache-build.js`, which now downloads all 36 breaks and no jazz (~130MB).
- Phase steps labeled in the UI: STEP 1 DIG / STEP 2 CHOP / STEP 3 DISS.
- Verified via raw-ws 2-player full-flow test (crate dealing, out-of-crate pick rejection, chop→battle beat payload fidelity, verse fills) + a separate 30s-timeout auto-pick test; the 6 trickiest catalog filenames HEAD-checked 200 against Archive.org.

**v3 write-up below (historical) — the Dig→Chop→Spit→Battle structure, onset tuning, TTS notes, and milestone history are still accurate; sample-source and dig-flow details are superseded above.**

**Why (v3):** the old design (dig a jazz loop in R1, dig a *separate* drum break in R2, BUILD stacks both in a slot-toggle grid) was structurally broken — the two loops had no shared tempo/downbeat, so BUILD just layered unrelated audio at arbitrary boundaries. No amount of mixing fixed it. Full pivot, inspired by Jackbox's Rap Battle: **Dig** one strong loop per player → **Chop** it with transient-snapping → **Spit** a mad-lib diss verse read aloud via TTS → **Battle**, round-based 1v1 (not all-play), directly reusing Stroke Off's bracket/pairing/voting system. See [[jakecrate-state]] memory for the full design conversation and rationale if this doc is ever out of sync with actual code — that memory file is the more detailed source during the rework.

**Status (update this table as milestones land):**
| Milestone | Status |
|---|---|
| 0. Delete dead/superseded code (old RECORD/DEAL screens, broken `BB_ROLES_V2` reconnect crash) | ✅ Done |
| 1. Room state + `bb_seedMatchups` (1v1 pairing, ported from Stroke Off's `sq_seedMatchups`) | ✅ Done, verified 2-11 players |
| 2. Dig phase — per-player `bb_pickSample`, player-keyed audio proxy `/api/bb-audio/:code/:playerId` | ✅ Done, verified distinct samples per player |
| 3. Onset detection (`bbDetectOnsets`) | ✅ Done, tuned + verified against 5 real cached tracks |
| 4. Chop phase — snap-to-onset waveform UI | ✅ Done, verified end-to-end (2-player Dig→Chop→lock round trip) |
| 5. Spit phase — mad-lib + TTS flow presets (Chipmunk/Villain/Straight/Auto-Tune) + ad-lib | ⏳ server+client built, verified server-side end-to-end — **still needs a real browser/phone check of the actual UI + iOS TTS-gesture behavior** |
| 6. Battle phase — sequential 1v1 judging (Stroke-Off-pattern) | ✅ Done, verified: full 3-round 2-player playthrough (correct point escalation + scoring + game over) and the 3-player bye mechanic |
| 7. Consistency pass (`rekeySocketState`, reconnect, cleanup) | ✅ Done, verified: disconnect mid-Chop doesn't crash the room for the remaining player |

**All 7 milestones are code-complete and locally verified through direct socket tests** — the full round loop (Dig→Chop→Spit→Battle→vote→next round→final results) works end-to-end, including the bye mechanic and reconnect resilience. Other games are unaffected. **What's genuinely NOT verified yet**: the actual browser UI has never been visually/interactively exercised (the preview browser tool was hung for the entire back half of this build — see the gotcha note below), and the iOS `speechSynthesis` gesture behavior specifically needs a real phone, which no amount of server-side testing can substitute for. **This is the one thing standing between "code done" and "actually done" — playtest it on real devices next.**

**New state machine:** `bbPhase`: `LOBBY → DIG → CHOP → SPIT → BATTLE → ROUND_END → RESULT`. DIG/CHOP/SPIT are simultaneous for all players each round; BATTLE is a sequential per-matchup loop (`bbCurrentMatchup` index into `bbMatchups[]`). `bb_seedMatchups` runs **before** Dig, not after — Spit's diss prompts need to know the opponent's name while writing.

**Key reuse (verified against actual code before this rework started):**
- `bb_fetchBatch`/`bb_pickSample`/`bbSamplePool` (Archive.org digging, already retargeted to blues/gospel/boogie/jazz 2026-07-01) — kept as-is, now called once per player instead of once per room.
- Waveform canvas/zoom/pan/Web Audio chain (gain→highShelf→compressor) — kept structurally, retargeted to snap-to-onset instead of raw scrubbing.
- Stroke Off's `sq_seedMatchups`/point-value-per-round/tie-safe voting — copied wholesale as `bb_seedMatchups`.
- Rizz or Roast's mad-lib template rendering and MediaRecorder ad-lib flow — adapted for Spit's diss prompts and the optional ad-lib stinger.

**TTS flow presets** (validated live via a throwaway demo before building): `chipmunk: {rate:1.65,pitch:2.0}`, `villain: {rate:0.72,pitch:0.25}`, `straight: {rate:1.0,pitch:1.0}`, `autotune: {rate:1.1,pitch:1.5}` (4th preset — honest caveat: not real T-Pain-style pitch-correction, `speechSynthesis` gives no manipulable audio buffer to actually pitch-correct, just another rate/pitch flavor). **Critical mobile constraint**: iOS Safari only fires `speechSynthesis.speak()` from inside a real tap — queue *all* of a verse's lines with back-to-back synchronous `.speak()` calls inside one tap handler, never via `setTimeout`. Writer's own Spit-preview tap covers their case; for Battle-phase spectators, each listener gets an explicit "▶ Hear the verse" tap-to-play button (decided over silently falling back to text-only, since hearing it spoken is the actual comedic payoff).

**Per-player Dig changed the audio proxy shape**: `/api/bb-audio/:code/:playerId` (new, per-player) alongside the old room-keyed `/api/bb-audio/:code` + `/api/bb-audio-r1/:code` + `/api/bb-audio-r2/:code` (kept transitionally until Milestones 4/5 finish replacing their remaining callers).

**Onset detection (`bbDetectOnsets`, `public/index.html`) — tuned constants, don't revert without re-testing:** windowed RMS envelope (20ms windows) → half-wave-rectified flux → adaptive threshold (local mean + **2.0×std**, up from an initial guess of 1.3×) → peak-picking with a **300ms** minimum-distance constraint (up from an initial guess of 120ms). The original pseudocode's constants (1.3×/120ms) were verified against 5 real cached 78rpm-era tracks and produced implausible 190-251 implied BPM — turned out to be picking up surface noise/crackle as false hits, not real transients. The tuned constants (2.0×/300ms) settled all 5 tracks into a consistent, musically-plausible 98-121 BPM band. If Chop's tick marks ever look wrong against real audio, re-run this same standalone verification (fetch a cached mp3 from `/bb-cache/audio/`, decode via `AudioContext`, call `bbDetectOnsets`, check `impliedBPM` from peak spacing) before assuming it's a UI bug.

**Chop phase (Milestone 4) — event contract + client mechanics:** server events renamed to match the new phase machine: `bbRoundStart` (round/matchup info, shown on `bb-crate-screen` with a "VS {opponent}" or "BYE" header) → per-player `bbDigReady` (track found, decodes buffer + runs `bbDetectOnsets`, caches ticks in `bbOnsetTicks`) → `bbChopPhase` (shows `bb-scrub-screen`, now labeled "CHOP YOUR LOOP"). Client-side helpers added in `public/index.html`: `bbOnsetIndexAt(t)`/`bbSnapToOnset(t)` (binary search to nearest tick), `bbLoopFromStart(startTime, hitCount)` (walks N onset ticks forward from a start point, falls back to a flat 0.4s/hit estimate if ticks aren't ready yet), `bbSetHitCount(n)` (replaces the old `bbSetLoopDuration(d)`; loop length is now "N hits" — 8 or 16 buttons, `#bb-hit-8`/`#bb-hit-16` — not a fixed second count), `bbDrawOnsetTicks` logic folded into `bbDrawWaveform` (teal tick marks drawn over the waveform, zoom-synced). Drag-to-position (`bbWireScrub`'s `setStartVisual`) now snaps to the nearest tick via `bbSnapToOnset` before computing the loop window — verified this lands exactly on tick values with zero jitter. Lock submission renamed `bbLockScrub`→`bbLockChop` (payload now `{start,end,hitCount,rate}`) and ack `bbScrubLocked`→`bbChopLocked`; server validation relaxed from a fixed 1-8s duration clamp to a generous 0.3-30s sanity clamp since loop length is now musical (tempo-dependent) rather than fixed. Deleted as dead weight while rewriting this phase: the R1-layer-preview toggle (`bbToggleR1Layer` + its button/volume slider — made no sense once each player digs only one track) and `bbBreakAt`/`bbAutoZoomToBreakAt` (the R2 "find the break" auto-zoom, gone now that there's no R2 drum-break round).

**Spit phase (Milestone 5) — event contract + mechanics:** one shared `BB_SPIT_TEMPLATES` entry is picked per round (14 templates in `index.js` — multi-line `\n`-joined mad-libs with `[OPP]` + `[NOUN]`/`[ADJECTIVE]`/`[VERB]`/`[PLACE]` blanks). Server substitutes `[OPP]` **per player** with their actual opponent's name (bye players get "the crowd") via `bb_oppNameFor(room, pid)` *before* emitting `bbSpitPhase` — the client's blank-regex (`bbRenderSpitTemplate`) never sees `[OPP]`, only real blanks, so no client changes were needed to handle the token. Client renders inputs the same way Rizz or Roast does (`bbCurrentSpitFills`/`bbAssembleSpitPreview` mirror `rrRenderTemplate`), picks one of 4 `BB_FLOW_PRESETS` (`bbSetFlowPreset`), can preview the assembled verse read aloud (`bbPreviewSpit` → `bbSpeakVerse`, called directly and synchronously from the tap handler — this is the exact call site that needs real-iOS verification), and picks an ad-lib stinger: either record their own (`bbToggleSpitRecord`, 6s cap, adapted from `rrToggleRecord`) or one of 4 synthesized canned stingers (`bbMakeAdlibSynth`: airhorn/laugh/scratch/boo — procedural, no real audio assets exist yet, matches the plan's zero-friction fallback decision). Submits via `bbSubmitSpit` → server validates fill count against the template's blank count, stores `room.bbSpitFills[pid]`/`bbFlowPreset[pid]`/`bbAdlibs[pid]`, acks `bbSpitLocked`, advances to `bb_beginBattle` (Milestone 6 stub) once everyone's submitted. `sanitizeName` now also strips `[`/`]` (index.js:54-55) so a player name can never inject a fake `[TOKEN]` into the substituted template. Verified via a hand-rolled raw-ws test (browser tool was down for this whole milestone): full 2-player Dig→Chop→Spit round, confirmed each player's template shows the *other* player's real name, blank counts match, both submissions ack correctly, `bb_beginBattle` stub reached without a crash. **Not yet verified**: the actual mad-lib/flow-picker/ad-lib UI in a real browser, and critically the iOS `speechSynthesis` gesture behavior on a real phone — do this before considering Milestone 5 done.

**Battle phase (Milestone 6) — event contract + mechanics:** direct rename of Stroke Off's `sq_beginBattle`/`sq_nextMatchup`/`sq_openVoting`/`sq_resolveMatchup`/`sq_endRound` pattern to `bb_*`. Sequential per-matchup loop (`room.bbCurrentMatchup` indexes `room.bbMatchups[]`): `bb_nextMatchup` broadcasts `bbBattleBegin` with both players' full verse (`lines`), `flowPreset`, and `adlib` — a 25s `BB_BATTLE_VIEW_SECS` window (listeners tap "▶ HEAR VERSE" per player, `bbHearVerse(1|2)`) auto-opens voting (`bbVoteOpen`, `BB_BATTLE_VOTE_SECS=10`) via `bb_openVoting`; votes are accepted the moment `bbBattleBegin` arrives though (matches Squiggle's exact quirk — no explicit "voting open" gate server-side, just a `room.bbVotes[socket.id]` dedupe + `room.bbPhase==='BATTLE'` check), so two eager voters resolve a matchup instantly without waiting the full window. `bb_resolveMatchup` awards `pointValue` (= round number) to the winner's `bbCumScores`/`bbRoundScores`, broadcasts `bbMatchupResult`, advances to the next matchup after 3s, or `bb_endRound` once all matchups in the round are done. `bb_endRound` reuses the OLD (previously-dead) `bbRoundResult`/`bbGameOver` event shapes and client handlers verbatim (`results:[{id,name,votes,roundPts,total}]` / `scores:[{id,name,score}]`) since those were already fully built from an earlier design iteration and structurally compatible — no client rewrite needed there, just server-side payload construction from the new per-matchup vote data. **TTS + ad-lib playback in Battle**: `bbHearVerse` plays the spitter's ad-lib (WebAudio/Audio, no gesture restriction once `AudioContext` is already running) and queues their verse via `bbSpeakVerse` — both triggered synchronously inside the listener's own tap, satisfying iOS's per-call gesture requirement individually for each of up to N listeners. Verified via two hand-rolled raw-ws playthroughs (browser tool still down for this milestone too): a full 3-round 2-player game with correct escalating points (1/2/3) and exact expected final scores, and a separate 3-player game confirming the bye player is excluded from matchups, still digs/chops, and sees "the crowd" substituted for `[OPP]` in their verse. **Testing note**: hit the exact same "listener registered after a fast-fired event" race in the test harness *twice* more this milestone (server code was fine both times) — the fix is always to register every listener for an entire chain of expected events up front, before triggering anything, with timeouts sized for the whole chain's cumulative duration rather than each step's own duration.

**Consistency pass (Milestone 7) — what got cleaned up:** deleted the entire now-fully-unreachable old BUILD/LISTEN/VOTE chain (`bb_beginBuild`/`bb_endBuild`/`bb_listenNext`/`bb_openVote`/`bb_endVote`, the `bbSubmitBeat` socket handler, `BB_DRUM_BREAKS`/`BB_BREAKS_DIR`/`bb_breakUrl`/`bb_pickDrumBreak`, `BB_ROUND_TYPES`/`BB_TOTAL_ROUNDS`/other now-orphaned constants, the transitional `/api/bb-audio/:code` + `/api/bb-audio-r1/:code` + `/api/bb-audio-r2/:code` routes, and client-side `bb-build-screen`/`bb-listen-screen`/`bb-vote-screen` + their render functions + the dead beat-scheduler/R2-loop/sound-synth clusters `bbSchedTick`/`bbStartBeat`/`bbStopBeat`/`bbStartR2Loop`/`bbStopR2Loop`/`bbMakeSynth`/`bbDecodeSound`/`bbPlayHit` + a handful of long-orphaned `BB_ROLES_V2`-era constants). **Found a real bug while doing this, not just cleanup**: there were *two* `socket.on('bbVote', ...)` handlers registered — the new Milestone 6 one (`{matchupIdx,choice}`) and a leftover dead one from the old all-play voting system (`{targetId}`, gated on `room.bbPhase==='VOTE'`). Both fired on every vote; it was only harmless because `bbPhase` is never actually `'VOTE'` anymore, which is a fragile coincidence, not a real guarantee — deleted the dead one. Also fixed: `rekeySocketState` was still rekeying old fields (`bbBeats`, `bbScrubLocks`) that no longer exist and *not* rekeying the new per-player maps (`bbSamples`, `bbChops`, `bbSpitFills`, `bbFlowPreset`, `bbAdlibs`) or `bbMatchups`/`bbByeId` — meaning a mid-round reconnect would have silently lost a player's progress data even though their new socket id would otherwise work fine; now mirrors Squiggle's exact `sqByeId`/`sqMatchups` rekey pattern. `bbReturnToLobby` was still resetting old-schema fields (`bbSample`, `bbScrubLocks`, `bbRecordings`, `bbHands`, etc.) that don't exist anymore instead of the real ones — rewritten to reset the actual current schema. Verified via a hand-rolled raw-ws test: dropped one player's connection mid-CHOP and confirmed the other player's connection stayed alive and kept getting valid responses (the room didn't crash), matching this milestone's explicit verification requirement.

**Debugging gotcha hit during Milestone 4 (worth remembering):** the local preview's Node server process does **not** hot-reload — editing `index.js` while `node index.js` is already running has zero effect until the process is stopped and restarted (`preview_stop` + `preview_start`). Client edits (`public/index.html`) DO take effect on a plain page reload since it's served fresh each request, which masked this for a while: a `bbLockChop` rename looked broken (no ack ever arrived) purely because the running server was still executing the pre-rename code. Symptom to watch for: state changes correctly but the corresponding ack/response never arrives. Separately, the `preview_eval`/`preview_snapshot`/`preview_screenshot` tools intermittently hang entirely (30s timeout, even on trivial expressions like `1+1`) independent of any code issue — when that happens, `preview_logs`/`preview_console_logs`/`preview_network` usually still work, and a same-node raw-`ws` test client (hand-rolled minimal Engine.IO/Socket.IO v4 framing — open packet `"0{...}"` → reply `"40"` → ack `"40{...}"` → events as `"42[event,payload]"`) is a reliable fallback for verifying server-side socket logic without the browser tool at all.

**Rejected designs (don't bring back):**
- 8-row 2×8 step-grid wall (too busy)
- Free-timing finger-drum loop-recorder with quantize/bars/roll/metronome (too open-ended)
- RECORD mouth-sounds + TUNE/deal-a-hand round (too many moving parts — this got fully deleted in Milestone 0 of this rework, it was already dead code)
- The jazz-loop + separate-drum-break two-sample design itself (this whole rework exists because that didn't work)

## Lobby / Room Management

**Flow:**
1. Hub screen → Create Room or Join Room with code (4-letter)
2. Room lobby shows: room code, player list, game picker, start button
3. Host picks game → start button appears
4. Rules overlay shows when game begins (8s, skippable)

**Events:**
- `roomCreated` — `{code}` → client joins and shows lobby
- `updatePlayers` — full player map, re-renders lobby chips
- `hostChanged` — `{hostSocketId}` → updates `isRoomHost`, re-renders
- `roomClosed` — everyone sent back to hub
- `kicked` — removed by host → back to hub

**Host transfer:** When host disconnects/leaves, `transferHostIfNeeded()` assigns crown to next player.

**Player count guards:** Each game has a minimum enforced in `rlStartGame()` before emitting `startGame`.

**Kick:** Host-only per-player button in lobby chips. Emits `kickPlayer({targetId})`.

**Unified scoreboard:** `#unified-scoreboard` in lobby shows cross-game scores for the session.

---

## Rules Overlays

Shown at start of each round, 8 seconds, skippable.

- **SO/MP rules** (`#so-rules-overlay`): shown on `soShowPainting`. `soSkipRules()` clears timer.
- **TS rules** (`#ts-rules-overlay`): shown on `gameState` phase → `HIDING`. Uses `position:fixed` (covers full-viewport canvas).

---

## Color System (TS + MasterPieced)

```js
let cHue, cSat, cLight;   // HSL components
function applyColor() {
    activeColor = `hsl(${cHue},${cSat}%,${cLight}%)`;
}
```

Shared by Sleight of Hands and MasterPieced. Color picker wheel (TS tool rail) and thumbnail eyedropper (MP draw phase) both update these same variables.

---

## Score Display

Unified scoreboard in lobby (`#unified-scoreboard`) aggregates all games.

Per-game scoring:
- **Sleight of Hands:** `survivals`, `catches` (in `room.scores`)
- **MasterPieced:** `correct`, `fakeWins` (in `room.soScores`)
- **Stroke Off:** round wins by bracket position
- **PikPic:** Dixit-style vote distribution (in `room.ppScores`)
- **Rizz or Roast:** 3/1/2pts per matchup
- **Split Crew:** quality + task completion points

---

## Known Issues / Pending Work

### Recently resolved / verified non-issues (2026-07-01 Sleight of Hands audit)
- **"Avatar renders as box"** — checked `rebuildHandCanvas()` in `public/index.html`: it correctly clips painted colors to the hand emoji's alpha silhouette via `destination-in` compositing (`handMasks[currentHandIdx]`). Renders as a proper blob, not a box. This item was stale and has been removed from the list below — the "box" some earlier report saw was almost certainly the brief solid-color fallback square shown before the first `rebuildHandCanvas()` pass completes, not a persistent bug.
- **Find Me / undo button overlap** — `#findMeBtn` was positioned at `top:60%`, which on shorter phone screens landed inside `#float-tools`' fixed-height button stack (pinned to `top:50%`, always visible alongside it during HIDING/SEEKING). Moved to `bottom:calc(64px + safe-area)` (bottom-right corner, anchored to the bottom edge instead of a percentage of screen height) so it can't collide with float-tools regardless of screen size. Also found and fixed a related edge case: opening the color/tools drawer (`#ts-drawer`) could still overlap the button on narrow/short screens — `toggleDrawer()` now hides `findMeBtn` while the drawer is open and restores it via `applyChromeVisibility()` on close; `closeDrawer()` (the separate path used when picking a color/hand/flip/lock-in from inside the drawer) was missing that restore call entirely and has been fixed to match.

### High priority
- **TS host end-round / pause:** No button for host to end a Sleight of Hands round early. MasterPieced has `#so-host-end-btn`; TS does not. Re-verified 2026-07-01 (`applyChromeVisibility`/`syncFloatMode` in `public/index.html` and the `index.js` TS socket handlers — no `tsHostEnd`-equivalent exists anywhere) — this is a real, still-missing feature, not stale.

### Medium priority
- **Eraser removal:** Both drawing games (MasterPieced + Stroke Off) should remove the eraser tool — keep only Undo. Currently eraser is still present.
- **MasterPieced countdown tick:** Timer countdown has a client-side tick bug (desync or missing decrement).
- **Brush-size label:** Both drawing games — the brush size number should display next to the slider.
- **PC layout for MasterPieced:** Portrait canvas centered in landscape browser is not optimized. Consider info panels beside canvas.
- **Spectator mode:** No way to join mid-game and watch.
- **Sound effects:** Zero audio across all games.
- **Reconnect UX:** Token dedup works silently; no "Reconnecting…" toast.
- **Connection status:** No visual feedback if socket drops.

### Nice to have
- Ready-up system per player before host starts
- Round X of Y display
- Custom room settings via lobby UI
- More meme images for MasterPieced (push to `PAINTINGS` array in `index.js`)
- PikPic: timer visible to Curator while others are submitting

---

## Adding Meme Images (MasterPieced)

Add entries to the `PAINTINGS` array in `index.js`:

```js
{
    title: 'Image Name',
    artist: 'Source · Year',
    imageUrl: 'https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/FILENAME.jpg?width=900',
    parts: [
        'description of part 1',
        // up to 8 parts; fewer is fine, more wraps round-robin
    ],
}
```

Use Wikimedia Commons `Special:FilePath` URLs — CORS-enabled, needed for thumbnail eyedropper.

---

## Deployment

```bash
git add public/index.html index.js   # (or specific files)
git commit -m "description"
git push origin master
# Render auto-deploys. Test on jakecrate.onrender.com
```

Render free tier — first load after idle may take ~30 seconds. Port set via `process.env.PORT`, falls back to 3000.

27. Winner podium added to all games

### June 29, 2026
28. PikPic Android fixes: touch drag-to-submit via `setPointerCapture` + ghost element (HTML5 DnD is desktop-only)
29. PikPic context menu suppression: `oncontextmenu="return false"` + `-webkit-touch-callout:none` on fan cards and vote images
30. Button/layout pass: `.pp-btn` padding reduced, drop zones compacted, fan-wrap height increased to 210px
31. HANDOFF updated to cover all 6 games
32. Bad Pitches (`beatbattle`) added as Game 7 — record/tune/build/battle beat-maker
33. Bad Pitches BUILD iterated twice: rejected the 8-row step-grid and the free-timing loop-recorder; landed on "pick a vibe, tweak one sound at a time" (commit `e8b72db`). Added TUNE round, per-sound color (`bbColorFor`), and tweak-travels-to-battle fix. HANDOFF now covers all 7 games.

### June 30, 2026
34. Bad Pitches completely redesigned (commit `d2c5655`): dropped RECORD/TUNE/mouth-sounds entirely. New flow: R1=jazz vinyl scrub → R2=curated drum break scrub (auto-zoom to break) → BUILD slot grid (JAZZ/DRUMS rows × N slots, toggle per cell) → LISTEN → VOTE. Hardcoded 8 UBB drum breaks with `breakAt` timestamps. Loop durations reverted to 4/6/8s. Slot-based scheduling (`bbScheduledSrcs`). `BB_TOTAL_ROUNDS=2`.

### July 1, 2026
35. Bad Pitches: R1 Archive.org search retargeted from `collection:georgeblood` alone (mostly 1930s-40s big-band/dance-orchestra) to a blues/gospel/boogie/bebop-jazz subject filter with waltz/military-band/dance-orchestra/holiday/symphony excluded — lands on genuinely sample-worthy 40s-50s material (commit `d8f2d36`).
36. PikPic photo-card polish pass 1 (commit `a793113`): fixed a real side-scroll bug where fan cards' rotation math assumed a fixed 72px width and didn't account for cards pivoting from their bottom edge (not center); cards now size dynamically (72-92px) from the fan wrap's real rendered width. Unified tap-to-enlarge across Upload/Result/Fan/Vote into one `#pp-lightbox` system, replacing a separate hold-to-preview overlay that only some screens had.
37. PikPic photo-card polish pass 2 (commit `3a5b267`): unified the polaroid look (white frame, thick bottom margin, shadow) across every photo display, not just the fan. Fan/wait-screen hand layout changed from a neat symmetric arc to a deterministic per-photo scattered "tossed on a table" look. Idle wait screen now shows the player's own hand instead of being blank. Renamed user-facing "card"→"pic" copy throughout. Along the way, found and fixed two pre-existing latent bugs: `calc(env(...)+Npx)` (missing space around the operator) was silently zeroing out padding on every PikPic screen plus the universal podium/Rizz or Roast/Split Crew's pit-stop header (invalid value inside a shorthand `padding` declaration drops the whole declaration); and a global bare `button { flex-grow:1 }` rule was stretching `#pp-lightbox-action` to fill the screen since nothing had a flex override for it.
38. PikPic upload-hang bug fixed (commit `bb8f999`): `ppResizeToDataUrl`'s canvas draw/export had no try/catch inside `img.onload`, so an old/odd-dimension photo throwing there (mobile canvas limits) left the promise hanging forever and silently killed the rest of that upload batch — explains "selecting a batch of older photos, most don't show up, one reappears next time." Fixed with try/catch+reject, a concurrency guard, and a single summary toast.
39. Sleight of Hands UI audit: confirmed "avatar renders as box" was stale (verified `rebuildHandCanvas()` correctly masks to a blob silhouette) and removed it from Known Issues. Confirmed "no host end-round button" is still real (re-checked against `index.js` and `applyChromeVisibility`/`syncFloatMode`). Found and fixed a genuine, always-present UI bug: `#findMeBtn` at `top:60%` overlapped `#float-tools`' undo button on shorter phone screens (float-tools is pinned to `top:50%` with a fixed pixel height, so a percentage-based sibling position wasn't reliably clear of it) — moved to a bottom-right, bottom-anchored position, plus fixed a related edge case where the color/tools drawer could still overlap it (`toggleDrawer`/`closeDrawer` now hide/restore `findMeBtn` correctly around the drawer's open state).
40. None of the above pushed to `origin/master` yet as of this entry (5 commits sitting local, PikPic-only verified via DOM inspection + a synthetic preview, not a live multiplayer playtest).
